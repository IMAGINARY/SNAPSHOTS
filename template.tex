\begin{abstract}[Plain text abstract used as PDF meta data (optional)]
This is your abstract. It should give a brief overview of your snapshot. If possible, please do not use formulas in your abstract. Please do not use more than 500 symbols. You will be asked to copy your abstract into the upload form on \href{http://www.imaginary.org}{www.imaginary.org}. 
\end{abstract}

%%% Please insert the main body of your snapshot, here.
\section{A heading}
Your actual snapshot.\footnote{This is a footnote.} As usual, you can give references such as \cite{snapshot, knuth1984texbook, wikiMath, sample13, sample12, sample11, sample14} via the \verb+\cite+ command.\\

We appreciate if you include images or other graphics that illustrate your snapshot. However, please do keep in mind the copyright issues explained in our email in case you include images and graphics you have not produced yourself.

%%% Please use this format to include images. Supported image formats: jpg, pdf, png. Please convert your images to those formats.
