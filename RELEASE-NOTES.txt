RELEASE-NOTES.txt of https://github.com/MFOberwolfach/SNAPSHOTS
===============================================================


release v2.0.0
==============
Many thanks to the junior editors for the suggested improvements!


notes
-----
Version 2.0.0 is downwards compatible in the sense that snapshots,
that can be compiled with v1.2.0 of snapshotmfo.cls can be
compiled with v2.0.0, too. However, the result will look different
as the default logo band has changed. 

Compile testsuite/test-template.tex to see which warnings should
remain and which should not. For details on the testsuite see
below.


features of snapshotmfo.cls and template.tex
--------------------------------------------
* logos updated
Snapshots submitted before 2017 must have \logoversionone in
the latex file. By default snapshots are now printed without
the logos of the Klaus Tischra Foundation and the
Oberwolfach Foundation on the last page.

* creditstext updated
The description of what the snapshots are should stay
identical in snapshotmfo.cls and in README.md.

* altered latex package trackchanges.sty added
The file as altered by Johannes Niediek has been added to
the repository. The use of the package must be activated
if needed. Being in the same directory as the latex file
it precedes files of the same name that possibly come
with the latex installation.

* latex package mathtools added in template.tex
The use of the package must be activated if needed.

* latex package wrapfig added in template.tex
The use of the package must be activated if needed.

* two or more junior editors are handled properly now
as explained in template.tex.

* overfullrule for proofreading added in template.tex
The line must be activated as needed.


added directories and files
---------------------------
* testsuite added
The directory "testsuite" has been added:
 - The script aux_.sh copies some files from the main directory
   into the testsuite directory, that are needed to compile the
   tex files.
 - The unit tests test-*.tex test most of the changes mentioned
   above case by case. 
 - The unit test test-template.tex documents the warnings when
   compiling template.tex.
 - The script all.sh runs aux_.sh, compiles all unit tests and
   merges the output into the single file all.pdf.
aux_.sh and all.sh are bash scripts that run on Linux and macOS.
aux_.cmd and all.cmd are batch scripts that run on Windows.
You may have to adapt these scripts to your system.
 
* release notes added
Comments on the previous releases were included in the e-mail
announcements.

fixed bugs
----------
* double slashes for mailto fixed
The e-mail addresses in mailto references in the pdf output were
preceded by two slashes.

* warning "DOI changed" fixed
For a snapshot number greater than or equal to 100 the
warning "snapshot number has changed" remained forever.

* warning "Connection to other fields changed" fixed
The warning remained forever in german snapshots connected to
the field "Betrachtungen Ã¼ber Mathematik".

* option of figure environment updated
The option h was replaced by ht to get rid of the respective
warning.
