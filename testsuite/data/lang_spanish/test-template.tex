% of \junioreditor, \senioreditor and \director, resp., will make the caption gender-specific, e.g.

% \junioreditor[m]{Martin Schuster}{schuster@example.org} will yield "Editor ..." instead of "Editor/in ...".

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% There are three ways to provide your references:
%%% 
%%% 1. by using the embedded .bib file:
%%%    * replace the references below by your own ones
%%%    * and leave the \bibliography command at the end of this file unchanged.
%%% This is the default way as it is a full-fledged BibTex solution
%%% while you have to edit only one file.
%%% 
%%% 2. by using a separate .bib file:
%%%    * provide your own .bib file,
%%%    * delete everything from \begin{filecontents} until \end{filecontents}
%%%    * and make the \bibliography command at the end of this file point to your .bib file.
%%% 
%%% 3. by using no BibTeX at all:
%%%    * delete everything from \begin{filecontents} until \end{filecontents}
%%%    * replace the \bibliography command at the end of this file with the
%%%      thebibliography environment containing a \bibitem command for each reference.
%%% This way is deprecated as it is less flexible than the BibTeX solutions.

\section{Comment on this unit test: test-template.tex}
test-template.tex differs from template.tex only by this section!
After the following compilations
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex test-template.tex
bibtex test-template.aux
pdflatex test-template.tex
pdflatex test-template.tex
\end{verbatim}
the following warnings will remain:
\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX Warning: Writing or overwriting file `./test-template.bib'.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: No snapshot id given.
Package isodate Warning: Language spanish unknown to isodate.
Package isodate Warning: Language spanish unknown to isodate.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: No mathematical subject given.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: No connection to other fields given.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: No license information given.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: Unable to compute DOI.

Warning--empty language in sample14
Warning--empty language in sample11
Warning--empty language in knuth1984texbook
Warning--empty language in sample12
Warning--empty language in sample13
Warning--empty language in wikiMath
\end{verbatim}

Using TeXnicCenter with MikTeX on Windows the final compilation summary will read:
\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX-Result: 0 Error(s), 6 Warning(s), 1 Bad Box(es), 5 Pages(s)
BibTeX-Result: 0 Error(s), 6 Warning(s)
\end{verbatim}

The ``overwriting file'' warning is inevitable as long as you provide the references the default
way, i.\,e. as an embedded .bib file.

The ``class snapshotmfo'' warnings will disappear as soon as you supply the expected information.

Do not make the ``empty language'' warnings disappear by supplying languages for the items,
unless you want the languages explicitely printed in the references!


%%% Please insert the main body of your snapshot here.
\section[Optional plain text substitute for PDF bookmark]{A heading}
Your actual snapshot.\footnote{This is a footnote.} As usual, you can give references such as \cite{knuth1984texbook, wikiMath, sample13, sample12, sample11, sample14} via the \verb+\cite+ command.\\

We appreciate if you include images or other graphics that illustrate your snapshot. However, please do keep in mind the copyright issues explained in our email in case you include images and graphics you have not produced yourself.

%%% Please use this format to include images. Supported image formats: jpg, pdf, png. Please convert your images to those formats.
\begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering 
        \includegraphics[width= 0.33 \textwidth]{mfo.jpg}
        \caption{An image scaled to 33\% of the textwidth.}
\label{fig:sample-image}
\end{figure}

\subsection[Optional plain text substitute for PDF bookmark]{A subsection}
More text and some formulas:
\begin{align}\label{real}
1+1&=2,\\\label{char.2}
1+1&=0.
\end{align}
Formula \eqref{real} refers to $\mathbb{R}$, Formula \eqref{char.2} does not.
