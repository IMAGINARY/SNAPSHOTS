LaTeX document class for the snapshots of modern mathematics from Oberwolfach
=============================================================================

"Snapshots of modern mathematics from Oberwolfach" are written by participants in
the scientific program of the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO).
The snapshot project is designed to promote the understanding and appreciation
of modern mathematics and mathematical research in the interested public worldwide.
It started as part of the project "Oberwolfach meets IMAGINARY" in 2013 with a
grant by the Klaus Tschira Foundation. The project has also been supported by the
Oberwolfach Foundation and the MFO. All snapshots can be found on
